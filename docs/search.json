    "text": "Data Description\nYou decide to use a systematic sampling approach to determine plot centres for n=4 plots. For each plot center, you establish a circular, fixed-area plot (r=11.27 m; 0.04 ha) aiming to sample all trees which are ≥ 2.0 cm DBH within this radius. Some plots had a lot of trees and thus a process of “Half Sweeps” was conducted, where a randomly chosen half of the 0.04 ha (or a slice) was selected and only trees in that half of the plot were recorded (i.e., each tree counts twice in the 0.04 ha plot OR the plot size was reduced to 0.02 ha).\nFor each tree (DBH≥2.0 cm) in the plot (full or half plot), the species was recorded and the DBH (cm) was measured. On a subset of trees, the height (m) was measured in the field. For the remaining trees, the height was estimated in the office using existing height/DBH models (i.e., for each tree without height, the species-specific models developed for this area were used to estimate height from DBH).  For broken trees, the height to the break was measured in the field, and an estimate of the height that the tree might have been if not broken was also recorded in the field. A snapshot of these data are provided below.\nFrom these data, you determine the characteristics of the forest land and report these to the landowner, along with your estimate of potential carbon credits.\n\n\n\nDescription of four selected plots including # trees & plot type\n\n\nPlotNo\nnumber_trees\nplot_type\n\n\n\n\n1\n15\nHalf\n\n\n2\n21\nFull\n\n\n3\n10\nHalf\n\n\n4\n12\nFull"

    "text": "Forest Management Problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile these are all fictional, they are based on actual forest management projects\n\n\nGroup 1\nA professional biologist’s group is concerned that high-school students in the greater Vancouver area have had little or no experience in natural areas.  They would like to provide a one-day workshop for 30 students that would focus on outdoor experiences as a pilot program, with the long-term objective of providing these workshops for 120 students per year.  For safety reasons, they plan to conduce the workshops in May when weather conditions might be better. They have obtained approval to conduct the workshops in the Mount Seymour Provincial Park https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/mt_seymour, just north of Vancouver. The students will have varying levels of abilities to walk in natural areas.  They have asked you to come up with a number of suitable areas within the park for activities of this workshop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome things to consider: What areas should be avoided? (Will students be able to walk over steep terrain? Will there be areas with snow?) What other uses might be competing with this student group use? Then, what should the teachers highlight for this student group? What should students learn about the natural environment? Where would you find these opportunities within the Park?\n\n\nGroup 2\nThe Emily Car School of Design has contacted the Mission Municipal Forest near Mission (www.mission.ca/city-hall/departments/forestry), BC about possibly supplying raw materials for creative wood designs. They are particularly interested in using hardwood materials. A number of the art and furniture pieces they would like to create are quite large, requiring bigger trees.  They are not able to pay a lot for the materials.  Also, they would like to have the materials in March next year.  The Director of Forestry for the Mission Municipal Forest (TFL26) asks you for some options to obtain 100 m3 of materials that might meet their needs.  You are asked to be particularly careful with the costs of obtaining the materials to keep costs down. At the same time, environmental concerns must be considered in any timber extractions, as well as any conflicts with other activities in this Forest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome things to consider: For this, first which hardwoods (literature)? Where are they? Are they large enough?  What about harvest and transport costs (Close to roads? )  Then, which areas to get 100 m3? What other activities might be competing with this request for materials? Environmental concerns?\n\n\nGroup 3\nDucks Unlimited (www.ducks.ca ) has obtained some interest from a private donor for sponsoring a bird habitat reservation area near Vancouver.  The Mayor of Mission hears about this and decides to make a “pitch” for a possible reservation of 30 ha within public lands near Mission, possibly within the Mission Community Forest (www.mission.ca/city-hall/departments/forestry or adjacent to it. You are asked to provide some options as to where this area should be located, as well as the reasons for this choice.  Since the interest was from Ducks Unlimited, there is particular interest in conserving water birds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome things to consider: First, what do birds need (literature)? Shelter + food + nesting habitat? Hardwoods for nesting birds? Should these be near roads or not? Near water?\n\n\nGroup 4\nThe fire return interval in the District of North Vancouver has been more than 100 years. However, with changes in climate, there are concerns that this may be changing to shorter intervals (https://www.dnv.org/community-environment/community-wildfire-protection-plan ) The District has obtained additional funds to reduce wildfire risks.  They would like to know where areas of higher fire risk might be, along with areas where fires might result in greater losses (timber, buildings, and other losses).  They expect to be able to reduce fire risk on 50 ha in the next year via selective (i.e., partial) harvest to reduce the amount of combustible materials. They have asked you to provide a few options as to which 50 ha they should target this year.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome things to consider for the information bits needed: First, what is considered a lower fire hazard (literature?) – elevation? Near lakes/rivers? Then, should the 50 ha be all in one space – or spread out over the District? How might any negative perceptions by publics regarding these forest changes be ameliorated though area selection?"

The forest was established in 1949 and is managed by staff to be commercially viable and financially independent of UBC. The forest is ~5,000 ha and covers a large mountainous area. Most of the forest is located in the Coastal Western Hemlock (CWH) biogeoclimatic (BEC) zone. As a result, some of the trees are very large (&gt; 2 m than diameter and over 65 m)."

    "text": "Task 1: Set Up QGIS\nStep 1: Open QGIS on your laptop. Choose ‘blank project.’ Save the project with a file name that you can remember and location you can remember. Ex: Exercise1_Map.qgz\nWhen you first open QGIS you will notice a main map canvas. To the left of this map canvas are two windows Browser and Layers. The Layers panel is the best way to understand the order of data on the main map canvas and is the best way to change the data presentation (symbology) and access the data in tabular format. On the top the QGIS menu are a series of additional buttons which we will introduce throughout this lab and course. Finally, on the bottom are the details of the map canvas including the current center or selected coordinate, the map scale, rotation, and the coordinate reference system (CRS).\nStep 2: Set the project CRS. In BC, the provincial standard CRS is NAD83/BC Albers map projection (EPSG:3005). To set the projects CRS navigate to the bottom left of the window and click on the EPSG:4326 as shown below:\nSearch for EPSG:3005 and click apply and ok.\nStep 3: Set up a ‘favorites’ folder to easily access the MKRF data. Right click on ‘Favorites’ and click add a directory. Navigate to the storage location for you MKRF data. Click ok.\n\nBuilding Familiarity\nStep 4: Add P_Boundary_MKRF.gpkg to the map. From the browser window select the file and drag and drop into the main map. This will add the boundary MRKF as a polygon feature. This layer is shown in the main map and listed in ‘layers’ on the left-hand ‘layers’ panel.\nStep 5: Change the symbology of the boundary file by right clicking on P_Boundary_MKRF.gpkg in the layers pane. Select Properties. A window will pop-up. On the left-hand side the layer properties including: General, Source, Symbology, Labels, Fields, Joins, Diagrams. Select Symbology (The icon with the paintbrush). Keep the format as ‘single symbol.’ Change the layer to have a black outline with no fill by clicking on the icon ‘simple fill.’ Change the fill color to ‘transparent’ and the stroke width to ‘0.2.’\nStep 6: Add L_streams_major.gkpg. In the ‘layers’ panel this will be the first, reflecting that this layer is above the boundary file. Change the color to something that represents streams (like.. blue?).\nStep 7: Navigate the around the map project by selecting the  icon. You can use the  to zoom and out.\nStep 8: Add the P_lakes.gpgk. Right-click on this layer in the layers panel and select Attribute Table. This gives details about the polygon features of the dataset. The shape area for each has been calculated in the ‘Shape_Area’ field.\n\n\nQuestion 1:\nHow many features (i.e. shapes) are in the P_lakes.gpkg?\n\n\nQuestion 2:\nWhere are the high versus low site indices relative to the terrain, relative to the north versus south, and relative to roads?"

    "text": "Task 2: Making a Site Index Map\nSite index is a measure of productivity. It is technically defined as: expected height (m) of the best trees (not damaged, biggest) of the dominant species at a reference age of 50 years breast height age. The site index reflects the potential of the site to grow this dominant species. Although this might also indicate how another species might do, this does not give a measure of the possible productivity of another species. For example, a site that is Douglas-fir leading and has a high site index would not indicate that a species like Whitebark pine (a high alpine species) would also do well. Also, if the soils change (e.g., landslides, fertilization, etc.) or the climate/hydrology changes, the site index might not be a good an indicator of the productivity for the historically dominant species. Importantly, for site index to be reported there have to be trees in the stand. In the MKRF dataset some recently harvested stands may show a “0” for site index, but this is really an NA.\nStep 1 Load P_ForestCover_1989.gpkg. Right click on the layer in the layers window and select Open Attribute Table. this will open an attribute table that describes the polygon components. Click on the the heading for SITEINDX to sort the table from smallest to largest site index. Many polygons have “0.0 m” for a site index value. Scroll right to the “Non-Forest Descriptor” or NFD columbn. Here notes like “NSR” note sites that are “not-satisfactorily restocked, or there may be lakes. These are examples of polygons where there are no trees and thus no site-index value.\nStep 2 Click to the SITEINDX column heading again to sort from largest to smallest. See ?sec-Q3 to answer. Close the attribute table.\nStep 3 Right click on the P_ForestCover_1989 layer again in the layers panel and select Properties\n\nSelect Symbology and change the symbol from “Single Symbol” to “Graduated.”\nUnder Value click the small down arrow on the right to select the “SITEINDX” column.\nIn the Color ramp field click the small down arrow on the right to select the “Viridis” color palette.\nAt the bottom of the symbology window, select Classify. This will classify the values in “SITEINDX” based on their values into different colors associated with the viridis color ramp.\nUnder Classify and Mode select “Equal Interval” and change the number of classes to “12”. Click Classify again.\nIn the Classes pain (the main white box) change these to 5 m classes as 0.00 to 0.00 (i.e., no site index), 0.05 to 5.05, 5.05 to 10.05, 10.05 to 15.05, etc.\nClick Apply and OK. The symbology window will close and you can now see your recolored layer.\n\n\nStep 4 Create a site index map to export as a picture. ::: {#tip-mapmaking .callout-tip} check out this link for some useful resources on making maps in QGIS :::\n\nSelect Project -&gt; New Print out Layout. Name your print layout “MRKF_1989SiteIndex” and click OK.

Change the orientation from “landscape” to “portrait”.  \nRight click on the map again and select Item Properties this time. Change the map scale (see the right-hand side of your screen for the properties) to expand your map to fill the page.  A good scale value is 50000 which means 1 cm on the map represents 0.5 km (50,000 cm)\nUse  on the left-hand side to add a Legend (the + sign appears in the cursor, drag the cursor and Legend appears).\nUse  to add a Scale Bar. Click on the Item Properties box. Change the “Division Units” to kilometres and then select a scale graphic you like.\nUse  to add a Title.\nAdd a north arrow by clicking  and drag the curse to the map area.\nRight click on each item on your map and select Item Properties to make any other changes to improve the appearance of your map. Alternatively, on the right-hand side there is Item properties icon where you can change the style of the items you added to the map (i.e., north arrow, legend, your map). NOTE: One could spend many hours on this! Just do some improvements.\n\nStep 5 Export your map as an image. Go to Layout and select Export as Image. Save the image the same location as your document you are recording lab responses.\n\nQuestion 3:\nWhat was the largest site index in m? What was the leading or dominant species for that polygon?

Each line of this table shows the attributes for one polygon (including SITEINDX that you already used). You can see the total number of polygons at the top of the Attribute Table (1149 polygons). Keep this attribute table open in this new window.\nStep 4 Select polygons where the first species is Western redcedar and the cedar is more than 50% of the species composition. To do so you will use a “Query.” To select polygons where the first species is Western redcedar and more than 50% of the species composition, you will need to do a query.\n\nIn the Attribute Table select  to open up the Query Fields.\nScroll down a bit to find “SPSC1” and “PCT1”, select for SPSC1=C and PCT1&gt;=50.

To calculate volume for the polygon, we need to use a measure of volume for the area. We have VOL7_5 which is the volume of trees per hectare that are &gt; 7.5 cm. We also have Shape_Area which is the area of the shape in m². We can use the following formula to calculate the volume per polygon.\n\\[Total~Volume (m³) = Polygon~Area (XX) * Volume (m³/ha) \\tag{2.1}\\]\nDo a unit calculation to set up the equation. Shape_area is in m² and VOL7_5 is in m³/ha.

    "section": "Lab Overview",
    "text": "Lab Overview\nBritish Columbia relies heavily on surveying from aerial imagery to understand forest health. Aerial surveys have been used throughout BC’s recent history to understand forest composition and health. Aerial imagery is the key input into the vegetation resource inventory (or VRI) used to understand the composition of BCs forests. The process has two phases:\n\nPhase 1: Using aerial imagery, forests are divided into homogeneous areas called “polygons.”\nPhase 2: Ground-reference plots are placed systematically throughout polygons. Ground-reference plots are used to determine the site-type or biogeoclimatic zone and subzone of each area. You can find more information on this process here.\n\nThese data are collectively used to obtain information on the forests of BC. However, since forests change over time, VRI also includes regular updates of original VRI data to reflect changes in forest composition associated with:\n\nLarge-scale natural disturbances: e.g., fires, insects, windthrow, etc.\nHuman disturbances: e.g., clear-cuts, partial harvests, roads, new urban areas, etc.\n\nThese new openings result in changes to polygon boundaries and attributes relative to prior dates for the same land area.  In addition, the attributes of each forested polygon are forecasted for stand-level growth to the current date (labelled as “Projected”).  For example, if the stand age was 50 years in 2000, the updated age (called “Projected Age”) in 2015 is 50+15=65 years. There are some attributes such as species composition that cannot be accurately updated via a forecast.  At some point, a re-inventory is needed. Typically, the Province does not regularly update the VRI layers for disturbances on private lands. The VRI for MKRF was actually updated to an entirely new reference year in 2020. We’ve included this data with the course and will introduce it at the end of lab. You can see that the 2014 VRI is largely the same as the 1996 VRI, but when the VRI was updated to a new reference year there were many changes."

    "text": "Task 1: Discover the difference between “Forest Cover” and VRI\nLast week, we used forest cover polygons to look at the forest cover from 1989 and briefly compared changes between 1989 and 1999. These forest cover polygons were created using interpretation of aerial imagery. Both VRI and forest cover polygons intrept components of forests using aerial imagery. However, their standards for photo-interpretation are different.\nIn our dataset, the forest cover polygons are based on photointepretation of 1987 photos, while the 2014 VRI is based on a 19996 aerial survey. Forest cover polygons are updated for natural and human disturbances, whereas VRI polygons are updated for the same disturbances. VRI polygons are also projected to the updated year. Additionally, VRI includes information on four different forest structure layers, from top canopy to the shrub layer. In this lab, we will work with the top of canopy layer. You can find out more on what attributes are recorded in the VRI data dictionary.\n\nBuilding Familiarity with VRI data\nStep 1: Open QGIS and save a new map project. Set up this project similarly to how we did in Task 1 lab 1 ?sec-maps.\nStep 2: Add the following layers to your blank map:\n\nP_Boundary_MRKF\nP_BC_VRI_2014\nP_ForestCover_1989\n\nStep 3: Select “P_BC_VRI_2014” and change the layer symbology. Change the outline to “white” ⬜change the fill color to “light grey” and increase the outline stroke width 0.2 mm. Click Apply and Ok.\nStep 4: Select the “P_ForestCover_1989” and change the symbology. Change the outline color to “orange🟧”.\nStep 5: Compare the VRI polygons to the 2006 Orthomosaic. Are there areas where the VRI projection does not make sense? To answer this, set the fill color for the VRI to semi-translucent and zoom to: 1250396, 481902 (*make sure your map CRS is set to BC Conus Albers; EPSG 3005). You can paste these values into the coordinate box on the bottom of the screen.\n\nStep 6: Load in P_ForestCover_2008. This is the updated forest cover layer as of 2006. Find the name of the forest disturbance that occurred in 2006 at the location identified in step 5.\n\n\n3.0.1 Question 1:\nWhich description of forest composition and structure (VRI and forest cover) has more polygons?\n\n\n3.0.2 Question 2:\nWhich descriptor of forest composition has a larger average polygon? Which one has a larger maximum polygon?\n\n\n3.0.3 Question 3:\nWhat is the projected age for the polygon at this site? Does this make sense? Why or why not? Insert a screenshot (include a figure caption!) to support your answer.\n\n\n3.0.4 Question 4:\nLook for two other forest disturbances or land-cover changes anywhere in MKRF recorded in the 2006 orthomosaic but not recorded in the 2014 VRI.\n\n\n3.0.5 Question 5:\nMalcolm Knapp is privately owned land, meaning not all disturbances are consistently added to VRI. Given this, what are some of the disadvantages of relying on VRI alone? What additional tools can we use to better update VRI? Respond in a clear and well written paragraph format."

Focus on Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2. These show initial steps in segmenting the land base into forest cover polygons. You will be interpreting a 2006 photo of area of MKRF using these two figures and “heads-up digitizing.” Normally, this first step would be done using a 3-D view of overlapping aerial images. You will be using a 2-D view for this first step in photo-interpretation to get an idea of how this is initially done. These larger polygons would be further stratified using forest cover attributes, and all attributes added as documented in the VRI photo-interpretation standards.\nStep 1 Add the 2008 and the 2006 aerial imagery to your map.

    "text": "Task 3: Understand Variability in Pixel Data\nWe have established an understanding of the key characteristics of different land cover types and how these relate to brightness values. We will now use QGIS to create a new polygon feature that will help better understand variability in pixel data, and how this variability can help us explore our datasets.\nStep 1 Create a new shapefile layer by going to Layer -&gt; Create a Layer -&gt; Create a new shapefile layer\n\nStep 2 Save your shapefile to the same location as your exercise two, name this layer “Landcover Types.shp”. For the Geometry Type select “polygon.” In the New Field window create a Text field called “class.” Make sure to click Add to Fields List. Click Ok. Your new layer should appear in the layers panel.\nStep 3 Right click on your new layer in the layers panel. Select Toggle Editing. The layer can now be actively edited.\nStep 4 Click on the polygon tool  in the upper left of the screen. This tool allows you to add new polygons to your shapefile. To add a polygon, left-click to begin a shape and add addition vertices. To finish a shape right-click. Use this process to add polygons that cover: (a) a fresh clearcut, (b) a lake, (c) an older clearcut, (d) a mixed forest, and (e) coniferous forest in the 2006 RGB image. When you finish a polygon make sure to note the landcover type in your “class” field.\n\nStep 5 once you have finished, right-click on your layer in the Layers panel to save the layer edits. Additionally, change the symbology of this layer to show the individual layer attributes. See an example in Figure 3.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Landcover types for polygon based on interpretation of 2006 aerial RGB imagery. Note that 2008 is shown in background\n\n\nStep 5 We will now introduce the processing toolbox. This is a great resource for finding tools that help analyze spatial data. The processing toolbox is normally located on the upper right-hand of of the QGIS window. If it is not there, you can load it by going to View -&gt; Panels -&gt; Processing Toolbox.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6 In the search bar located at the top of the processing toolbox type in “Zonal” and select Zonal statistics. In the pop-up window make the following selections\n\nInput layer: Select your class polygons\nRaster layer: Select the 2006 RGB image\nRaster band: Select the green band\nOutput column prefix: type “Brt” (for pixel brightness values)\nRight click on the “…” in statistics to calculate. In the new menu select (1) Mean (2) St Dec (2) Minimum and (3) Maximum\nSave the file to the same location as your exercise 2\n\n\nStep 7 Using the new shapefile, color the shapefile by mean brightness. Under symbology select “graduated” and for the color palette choose “greys.” At the top to the color palette window choose invert color ramp. Inverting the color ramp means that the polygons where the mean brightness values is low will be closer to black and polygons where the mean brightness is high will be closer to white.\nStep 8 We will now create a new map layout to showcase some the forest cover polygons we have created. Go to file New print layout and create a new map layout named “forest cover polygons.” Make the orientation of new map is horizontal. Our new map layout will have three different sub-maps. The first will describe the forest cover polygons we have created. The second will describe in the mean brightness for the RGB data we have. Finally, we will have a third map that displays the variability in the brightness responses of our different forest cover polygons.\nStep 9 We’ll start with the map that describes our forest polygons.\n\nChange the symbology of the forest polygons shapefile to give each polygon a unique color. Go to symbology -&gt; categorized -&gt; select your “class” field -&gt; and classify. Click Apply but NOT ok.\nOn the left-hand of this pop-up window go to “labels” and select Single Label for Value select your “class” field.\nClick on Buffer and check the box that says Draw text Buffer this will put a small white buffer around our labels.\nClick on Placement change the mode to Offset from centroid. Click the box that says Allow placing of labels outside of polygons. Change the Quadrant to the upper-left\nClick Apply - labels should now appear on the map canvas.\nClick Ok.\n\n\n\nNavigate back to your map layout. Insert a new map for your forest polygons. In the background, include the BC VRI and 2008 RGB image. The screenshot below highlights what should be included. Set the map scale to 70000 to best include all of MKRF.\n\n\n\nIn the right-hand side under Layers click the checkmark that says Lock layers and Lock styles for Layers this prevents your map from automatically updating.\nAdd a legend. In Legend items uncheck “auto update” and remove all legend items that are are not your forest cover polygons. On the forest polygon layer right-click to check “hidden.” In the Title for the legend put “Forest Polygon Class”\nRight click on the map on your map layout to copy and paste the map so there is a duplicate map next to your forest polygon map. With this new map selected, uncheck the Lock layers and Lock styles for Layers. Navigate back to your map canvas.\n\nStep 9 We’ll now map the average green brightness value in these polygons.\n\nUsing your layer that we calculated zonal statistics on, which should still be colored black-to-white. Move this layer to the top of the map canvas.\nNavigate back to your map layout. With the copied map selected, change the name to “zonal mean.” In the item properties tab click the circular “refresh” button. This will update the map to the current canvas layers. Click Lock layers and Lock styles for Layer.\n\nCopy the Legend from your polygons layer. Change the reference map to the zonal statistics map. In the legend properties check “update all”. Change the Title to “Mean Bit Brightness (Green Band)”.\n\nRight click on the map on your map layout to copy and paste the map so there is a duplicate map next to your forest zonal statistics map. With this map selected, uncheck the Lock layers and Lock styles for Layers. Navigate back to your map canvas.\n\nStep 10 Follow a similar process to step 9, but this time change the zonal statistics layer to the standard deviation. See Figure 3.2 for an example of your final output.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Example output for forest cover map. **Note your map will be different according to where you place your polygons.\n\n\n\nQuestion 9:\nHow do values for your different forest polygons layer differ in terms of brightness? What feature had the highest greenness reflectance? Which feature had the most variable greenness reflectance? Use values to support your results.\n\n\nQuestion 10:\nNormally, photo-interpreters would have a 3-D view of a stereo-pair of photos and they could see and measure stand heights. What other information might help the photo-interpreter assign heights to each stand? HINT: As well as imagery, what other information might they access? How do other attributes impact height?\n\n\nMap 1:\nInclude your map describing your forest polygon layer and the associated brightness values from the 2006 orthophoto."

    "text": "Task 4: Satellite Images Compared to Aerial Photographs\nImages collected using satellites provide the base data used to create Google Maps, Google Earth Views, etc. Of these, data collected by Landsat satellites is very common used. However, other imagery is often needed to provide finer spatial detail, historic views, and 3-D views. You will learn more about other imagery in FRST 538. For now, you will look at the Landsat imagery provided for MKRF and compare these to the aerial photographs. Specifically, you will look at how these images might be used to update after natural and human disturbances.\nStep 1 Add the 2019 Landsat RGB image, keeping both the 2008 and 2006 orthoimages loaded. Clearly, there are differences in the spectral reflectance and the resolution of these two images. However, Landsat is free and has consistently captured images of our earth from two-weeks (when it is cloud free) since its launch in the 1970s.\nStep 2 Qualitatively compare the orthoimages from the satellite data. Use this to answer the last lab question.\n\nQuestion 11:\nIf you were monitoring a forest area for harvest disturbances, would you choose to get new aerial photographs or would you use available Landsat data? Consider the costs, the spatial resolution of the images relative to the disturbance size, and the frequency that images are acquired.\n\n\nQuestion 12:\nWhat about using Landsat data for something like small-scale wind damage? Or small-scale fires? What about roads?"

    "text": "Task 2: Making a Site Index Map\nSite index is a measure of productivity. It is technically defined as: expected height (m) of the best trees (not damaged, biggest) of the dominant species at a reference age of 50 years breast height age. The site index reflects the potential of the site to grow this dominant species. Although this might also indicate how another species might do, this does not give a measure of the possible productivity of another species. For example, a site that is Douglas-fir leading and has a high site index would not indicate that a species like Whitebark pine (a high alpine species) would also do well. Also, if the soils change (e.g., landslides, fertilization, etc.) or the climate/hydrology changes, the site index might not be a good an indicator of the productivity for the historically dominant species. Importantly, for site index to be reported there have to be trees in the stand. In the MKRF dataset some recently harvested stands may show a “0” for site index, but this is really an NA.\nStep 1 Load P_ForestCover_1989.gpkg. Right click on the layer in the layers window and select Open Attribute Table. this will open an attribute table that describes the polygon components. Click on the the heading for SITEINDX to sort the table from smallest to largest site index. Many polygons have “0.0 m” for a site index value. Scroll right to the “Non-Forest Descriptor” or NFD columbn. Here notes like “NSR” note sites that are “not-satisfactorily restocked, or there may be lakes. These are examples of polygons where there are no trees and thus no site-index value.\nStep 2 Click to the SITEINDX column heading again to sort from largest to smallest. See ?sec-Q3 to answer. Close the attribute table.\nStep 3 Right click on the P_ForestCover_1989 layer again in the layers panel and select Properties\n\nSelect Symbology and change the symbol from “Single Symbol” to “Graduated.”\nUnder Value click the small down arrow on the right to select the “SITEINDX” column.\nIn the Color ramp field click the small down arrow on the right to select the “Viridis” color palette.\nAt the bottom of the symbology window, select Classify. This will classify the values in “SITEINDX” based on their values into different colors associated with the viridis color ramp.\nUnder Classify and Mode select “Equal Interval” and change the number of classes to “12”. Click Classify again.\nIn the Classes pain (the main white box) change these to 5 m classes as 0.00 to 0.00 (i.e., no site index), 0.05 to 5.05, 5.05 to 10.05, 10.05 to 15.05, etc.\nClick Apply and OK. The symbology window will close and you can now see your recolored layer.\n\n\nStep 4 Create a site index map to export as a picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\ncheck out this link for some useful resources on making maps in QGIS QGIS Beautiful Maps\n\n\n\nSelect Project -&gt; New Print out Layout. Name your print layout “MRKF_1989SiteIndex” and click OK. A blank space appears in a new window with new Layout icons along the left-hand side.\nIn the left-hand of this new window, select  to (Add a New Map to the Layout). A + sign appears as a cursor. Drag the cursor around the blank area. Your map appears in this print layout.  NOTE: If you do not see a map in Layout View use Zoom Whole Page You may also need to reposition the map in the copied box using:\n\n\n\nRight click on your map and select Page Properties. Change the orientation from “landscape” to “portrait”.  \nRight click on the map again and select Item Properties this time. Change the map scale (see the right-hand side of your screen for the properties) to expand your map to fill the page.  A good scale value is 50000 which means 1 cm on the map represents 0.5 km (50,000 cm)\nUse  on the left-hand side to add a Legend (the + sign appears in the cursor, drag the cursor and Legend appears).\nUse  to add a Scale Bar. Click on the Item Properties box. Change the “Division Units” to kilometres and then select a scale graphic you like.\nUse  to add a Title.\nAdd a north arrow by clicking  and drag the curse to the map area.\nRight click on each item on your map and select Item Properties to make any other changes to improve the appearance of your map. Alternatively, on the right-hand side there is Item properties icon where you can change the style of the items you added to the map (i.e., north arrow, legend, your map).
