You will work with formulas, created from test data, to understand a forest-stand. Using your estimates you will produce a data summary for a landowner. You may work in groups for this lab, but each student must be able to run the code on their own computer."

The owner would also like to know general information about the timber characteristics for general management purposes."

    "text": "Data Description\nYou decide to use a systematic sampling approach to determine plot centres for n=4 plots. For each plot center, you establish a circular, fixed-area plot (r=11.27 m; 0.04 ha) aiming to sample all trees which are ≥ 2.0 cm DBH within this radius. Some plots had a lot of trees and thus a process of “Half Sweeps” was conducted, where a randomly chosen half of the 0.04 ha (or a slice) was selected and only trees in that half of the plot were recorded (i.e., each tree counts twice in the 0.04 ha plot OR the plot size was reduced to 0.02 ha).\nFor each tree (DBH≥2.0 cm) in the plot (full or half plot), the species was recorded and the DBH (cm) was measured. On a subset of trees, the height (m) was measured in the field. For the remaining trees, the height was estimated in the office using existing height/DBH models (i.e., for each tree without height, the species-specific models developed for this area were used to estimate height from DBH).  For broken trees, the height to the break was measured in the field, and an estimate of the height that the tree might have been if not broken was also recorded in the field. A snapshot of these data are provided below.\nFrom these data, you determine the characteristics of the forest land and report these to the landowner, along with your estimate of potential carbon credits.\n\n\n\nDescription of four selected plots including # trees & plot type\n\n\nPlotNo\nnumber_trees\nplot_type\n\n\n\n\n1\n15\nHalf\n\n\n2\n21\nFull\n\n\n3\n10\nHalf\n\n\n4\n12\nFull"

    "text": "Forest Management Problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile these are all fictional, they are based on actual forest management projects\n\n\nGroup 1\nA professional biologist’s group is concerned that high-school students in the greater Vancouver area have had little or no experience in natural areas.  They would like to provide a one-day workshop for 30 students that would focus on outdoor experiences as a pilot program, with the long-term objective of providing these workshops for 120 students per year.  For safety reasons, they plan to conduce the workshops in May when weather conditions might be better. They have obtained approval to conduct the workshops in the Mount Seymour Provincial Park https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/mt_seymour, just north of Vancouver. The students will have varying levels of abilities to walk in natural areas.  They have asked you to come up with a number of suitable areas within the park for activities of this workshop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome things to consider: What areas should be avoided? (Will students be able to walk over steep terrain? Will there be areas with snow?) What other uses might be competing with this student group use? Then, what should the teachers highlight for this student group? What should students learn about the natural environment? Where would you find these opportunities within the Park?\n\n\nGroup 2\nThe Emily Car School of Design has contacted the Mission Municipal Forest near Mission (www.mission.ca/city-hall/departments/forestry), BC about possibly supplying raw materials for creative wood designs. They are particularly interested in using hardwood materials. A number of the art and furniture pieces they would like to create are quite large, requiring bigger trees.  They are not able to pay a lot for the materials.  Also, they would like to have the materials in March next year.  The Director of Forestry for the Mission Municipal Forest (TFL26) asks you for some options to obtain 100 m3 of materials that might meet their needs.  You are asked to be particularly careful with the costs of obtaining the materials to keep costs down. At the same time, environmental concerns must be considered in any timber extractions, as well as any conflicts with other activities in this Forest. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome things to consider: For this, first which hardwoods (literature)? Where are they? Are they large enough?  What about harvest and transport costs (Close to roads? )  Then, which areas to get 100 m3? What other activities might be competing with this request for materials? Environmental concerns?\n\n\nGroup 3\nDucks Unlimited (www.ducks.ca ) has obtained some interest from a private donor for sponsoring a bird habitat reservation area near Vancouver.  The Mayor of Mission hears about this and decides to make a “pitch” for a possible reservation of 30 ha within public lands near Mission, possibly within the Mission Community Forest (www.mission.ca/city-hall/departments/forestry or adjacent to it. You are asked to provide some options as to where this area should be located, as well as the reasons for this choice.  Since the interest was from Ducks Unlimited, there is particular interest in conserving water birds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome things to consider: First, what do birds need (literature)? Shelter + food + nesting habitat? Hardwoods for nesting birds? Should these be near roads or not? Near water?\n\n\nGroup 4\nThe fire return interval in the District of North Vancouver has been more than 100 years. However, with changes in climate, there are concerns that this may be changing to shorter intervals (https://www.dnv.org/community-environment/community-wildfire-protection-plan ) The District has obtained additional funds to reduce wildfire risks.  They would like to know where areas of higher fire risk might be, along with areas where fires might result in greater losses (timber, buildings, and other losses).  They expect to be able to reduce fire risk on 50 ha in the next year via selective (i.e., partial) harvest to reduce the amount of combustible materials. They have asked you to provide a few options as to which 50 ha they should target this year.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome things to consider for the information bits needed: First, what is considered a lower fire hazard (literature?) – elevation? Near lakes/rivers? Then, should the 50 ha be all in one space – or spread out over the District? How might any negative perceptions by publics regarding these forest changes be ameliorated though area selection?"
